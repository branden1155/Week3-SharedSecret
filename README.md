# Week3-SharedSecret
 
### This is the second assignment of including Shared Secrets with all files on the repository.

### The Shared Secrets are included inside the .env file.
### The node project will run as suspected due to the .env file being provided inside the file list.

### The hostname, port number, and secret are given the value process.env.(varName),
### therefore the values for these variables are being hidden in a seperate file on the repository, which is (.env).


### Their is a commented line showing where they are inputted into the code.


### When this node application is started, the application should connect to the server using the hostname, '127.0.0.1', and port number, '3000'. It should also transfer the secret value into a console.log() displaying the SECRET_KEY.
